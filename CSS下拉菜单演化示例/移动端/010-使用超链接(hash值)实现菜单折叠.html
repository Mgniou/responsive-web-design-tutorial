		<p>You'll notice that we only specified one delay time, while we are using two transitions: visibility and opacity. According to the CSS3 specification, when there aren't enough delay values to go around, they are repeated to apply to all transitions. In this case, the opacity transition had a 0s delay by default so it actually doesn't change.How about that, it works! With a temporary change in the delay value of the transition, we successfully created a drop-down menu that both fades-in and fades-out very nicely, and also doesn't interfere with content beneath it. But is looking nice the end of the story?</p>
